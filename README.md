Pharmaceutical waste such as antibiotics are considered emerging environmental contaminants due to their continuous release and persistence in the environment. The removal 
of amoxicillin from aqueous solutions by the adsorption process on commercial activated carbon was carried out using a modular method. The maximum parameters for a high recovery rate: pH= 5, adsorbent quantity 0.1 g, antibiotic solution concentration 0.9g/l, contact time 60 min and temperature 45°C were obtained in a modular way. Isotherm studies confirmed that the Langmuir model is the representative isotherm of the adsorption phenomenon. In parallel, a prediction study of adsorption efficiency using a Machine Learning (ML) approach was carried out using 3 models, which produced a Root Mean Square Error RMSE (4.855, 4.675, 8.190) and a correlation coefficient R²(0.960, 0.963, 0.888) for Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) respectively, and after validation using our experimental results that resulted from the R² (0.897, 0.929, 0.727) and RMSE (8.165, 6.794, 12.816) obtained by the RF, GBT and MLP models respectively, this suggests that the models effectively captured the underlying patterns and relationships in the experimental data, enabling accurate predictions of the removal efficiency of amoxicillin based on the input parameters.
